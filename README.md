# NLP-Project-on-Hospital-review
Project is to do the sentiment analysis on the Hospital review data. 
I have done the data preprocessing like cleaning the null values, converting the categorical values to numerical, tokenization, stemming, stop words removal, Pos tagging etc. 
I have converted the Rating into positive, negitive sentiment.
I have done the sentiment analysis model. 
Evaluated the model by the accuracy of the model.
# Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can classify sentiments in healthcare reviews. This involves analyzing text data from healthcare reviews and determining whether the sentiment expressed in each review is positive, negative, or neutral.

# Tasks
Data Preprocessing: This task involves cleaning and preparing the text data from healthcare reviews. It includes tasks like text tokenization, removing stopwords, and handling any missing data.
Sentiment Analysis Model: Develop a machine learning or natural language processing (NLP) model that can classify sentiments in healthcare reviews. This model should be able to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on the text content.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the sentiment analysis model using appropriate evaluation metrics. This step is crucial to ensure the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
# Model Building
Models used for comparison are listed below.

svm 
KNN Classifier
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Decision tree

# Final thoughts and Insights
The dataset has just 9 statements in "Review Text" column which has been segmented into all 3 classes(+ve, -ve) - Looks like a toy dataset. So, the model is not performing properly. Therefore, we are not able to retrieve insights from the data.
People are satisifed with the healthcare provider(doctor).
Some are willing to come back to this hospital.
Some people are not happy as they had a terrible experience.
Some people have mixed emotions about the healthcare center.
